## Embedded Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny application located in another directory:

```{r Intro to Shiny app, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package="shiny"),
  options=list(
    width="100%", height=550
  )
)
```

```{r, Individual Assignment, eval = F}
#ui.R

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("censusVis"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      helpText("Create demographic maps with 
               information from the 2010 US Census."),
      
      selectInput("var", 
                  label = "Choose a variable to display",
                  choices = list("Percent White", "Percent Black",
                                 "Percent Hispanic", "Percent Asian"),
                  selected = "Percent White"),
      
      sliderInput("range", 
                  label = "Range of interest:",
                  min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
      ),
    
    mainPanel()
  )
))
```
